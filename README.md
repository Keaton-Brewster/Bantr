### This is a simple app for the sole purpose of providing a more private way of storing individual or group messages

For questions about development, reach out to me at keatonbrewsterdev@gmail.com.

The purpose of the app is not so much full-scale industry viability, but rather proof of concept and a challenge to build a complex system from the ground up. 

Collaboration is welcome
